# AWS S3 Gradle build cache

[![Gradle Plugin Portal](https://img.shields.io/maven-metadata/v/https/plugins.gradle.org/m2/com/github/burrunan/s3cache/s3-build-cache/maven-metadata.xml.svg?colorB=007ec6&label=gradle-plugin-portal)](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.github.burrunan.s3-build-cache)
[![CI Status](https://github.com/burrunan/gradle-s3-build-cache/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/burrunan/gradle-s3-build-cache/actions)

This is a custom Gradle [build cache](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_cache.html)
implementation which uses [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to store the cache objects.

This plugin is a fork of [myniva/gradle-s3-build-cache](https://github.com/myniva/gradle-s3-build-cache).
 [Burrunan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrunan_dolphin) adds lots of performance, functional, and security features.
See [v1.0.0 release notes](CHANGELOG.md)

Key improvements are (as of 2020-07-24):
- Improved security: the plugin requires only `GetObject` permission, and it does not need `ListObjects`
- Improved security: the plugin uses its own configuration properties rather than default AWS credentials by default
- Faster cache population: cache entries are sent as `File` objects rather than buffering to memory
- Faster cache retrieval: cache lookup performs one network request rather than two
- `maximumCachedObjectLength` property to avoid unexpectedly large remote cache transfers
- Elaborate details on cache performance
- Cached items contain metadata (elapsed duration, task name, Gradle version) which help to analyze the cache contents

## Compatibility

* Version 1.0.0 - Gradle 4.1+
* Gradle configuration cache - Gradle 7.5+, see https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/14874

## Use in your project

The plugin is stable, so we encourage you to use it in your projects.

Feedback is very welcome.
Please open an [issue](https://github.com/burrunan/gradle-s3-build-cache/issues) if you find a bug or 
have an idea for an improvement.


### Apply plugin

The Gradle build cache needs to be configured on the Settings level. As a first step, add a
dependency to the plugin to your `settings.gradle` file. Get the latest version from [Gradle plugin portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.github.burrunan.s3-build-cache).

```
plugins {
  id("com.github.burrunan.s3-build-cache") version "1.5"
}
```

### Configuration

The AWS S3 build cache implementation has a few configuration options:

Note: if both `awsAccessKeyId` and `awsSecretKey` are `nullOrBlank` (`null` or whitespace only), then anonymous credentials are used.

The `buildCache` configuration block might look like this:

Groovy DSL

```gradle
// This goes to settings.gradle

apply plugin: 'com.github.burrunan.s3-build-cache'

ext.isCiServer = System.getenv().containsKey("CI")

buildCache {
    local {
        // Local build cache is dangerous as it might produce inconsistent results
        // in case developer modifies files while the build is running
        enabled = false
    }
    remote(com.github.burrunan.s3cache.AwsS3BuildCache) {
        region = 'eu-west-1'
        bucket = 'your-bucket'
        prefix = 'cache/'
        push = isCiServer
        // Credentials will be taken from  S3_BUILD_CACHE_... environment variables
        // anonymous access will be used if environment variables are missing
    }
}
```

Kotlin DSL:

```kotlin
// This goes to settings.gradle.kts

plugins {
    id("com.github.burrunan.s3-build-cache") version "1.5"
}

val isCiServer = System.getenv().containsKey("CI")

buildCache {
    local {
        // Local build cache is dangerous as it might produce inconsistent results
        // in case developer modifies files while the build is running
        enabled = false
    }
    remote<com.github.burrunan.s3cache.AwsS3BuildCache> {
        region = "eu-west-1"
        bucket = "your-bucket"
        prefix = "cache/"
        push = isCiServer
    }
}
```

More details about configuring the Gradle build cache can be found in the
[official Gradle documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_cache.html#sec:build_cache_configure).


### S3 credentials

It is recommended you specify credentials that have limited access to S3 resources, that is why
plugin retrieves credentials from `S3_BUILD_CACHE_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `S3_BUILD_CACHE_SECRET_KEY`, and `S3_BUILD_CACHE_SESSION_TOKEN`
environment variables.

If you want to use AWS default credentials [`DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain`](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain.html),
then configure `lookupDefaultAwsCredentials=true`.

If you want to use a specific [AWS profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials-profiles.html),
then configure `awsProfile="<profile_name>"`.

Note: even with these values set, it will still try `S3_BUILD_CACHE_` variables first.

### S3 Bucket Permissions for cache population

Note: if you use a path prefix (e.g. `build-cache`), you might want to configure the permission to that subfolder only. 
 
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
          "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
          "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### S3 Bucket Permissions for reading data from the cache

If you use a path prefix (e.g. `build-cache`), you might want to configure the permission to that subfolder only.

Note: if you don't have enough permissions to access the item, it will be treated as "cache miss".  
 
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
          "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
          "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Measuring cache efficiency

It is important to measure the efficiency of the caching, otherwise it might happen the caching increases
build time (e.g. it downloads too large artifacts over a slow network or cache misses are too frequent).

Luckily many cache items include the time it took to build the task, so when the item is loaded
from the cache, the time saved can be estimated as `original_task_elapsed_time - from_cache_task_elapsed_time`.

The plugin prints cache statistics at the end of the build (you can disable it with `showStatistics=false`):

```
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 6s
1 actionable task: 1 executed
S3 cache 232ms saved (242ms saved on hits, 10ms wasted on misses), reads: 2, hits: 1, elapsed: 91ms, processed: 477 B
S3 cache writes: 1, elapsed: 121ms, sent to cache: 472 B
```

S3 reads:
* `saved: 232ms` – overall estimation of the remote cache impact on the build time 
Note: this estimation does not account for parallel task execution.
* `242ms saved on hits` – the estimated time saved by the remote build cache (`original_task_elapsed_time - from_cache_task_elapsed_time`).
Note: this estimation does not account for parallel task execution. `saved on hits` means the cache helps,
and `wasted on hits` means the estimated execution time would be less than the cache load time.
* `10ms wasted on misses` – the amount of time spent for `cache misses`
* `reads: 2` – number load requests to the remote cache
* `hits: 1` – number items loaded from the remote cache
* `elapsed: 233ms` – total time spent on loading items from remote cache
* `processed: 0 B` – number of bytes loaded from the remote cache

S3 writes:
* `cache writes: 1` – number of store requests to the remote cache
* `elapsed: 115ms` – time spent uploading items to the remote cache
* `sent to cache: 472 B` – number of bytes sent to the remote cache

### S3 metadata

The stored cache entries might include metadata. The metadata helps to estimate cache efficiency,
and it might be useful to analyze space consumption.

| Key               | Type        |  Sample                    | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------- | -------------------------- | ----------- |
| buildInvocationId | String      | rpha3qmrzvbnxhmdlvukwcx7ru | Build Id |
| identity          | String      | :example:test              | Task identifier |
| executionTime     | Long        | 189871                     | Task execution time, milliseconds |
| operatingSystem   | String      | Linux                      | Operating system |
| gradleVersion     | String      | 6.3                        | Gradle version |

### Expiring cache entries

This plugin does not deal with expiring cache entries directly but relies on S3 object lifecycle management to do so.
Cache entry expiration rules can be set on S3 buckets using [AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTlifecycle.html) or via [AWS Management Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/create-lifecycle.html).
